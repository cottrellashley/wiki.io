1. This is the simplest physical system we can think of wihout abstracting away lower smaller systems. We are assuming this is the bottom and you cannot abstract more lower down. This is not an emergent system with emergent properties.
2. We are only considering a small cross section within a small time section too. Meaning if you zoomed in to a tiny tiny scetion of the universe for a short short period of time, this system is the simplest. It is obvious that if our cross section is large and long enough period of time, we can consider the whole universe. Which itself containes all of the complexity we could ever consider in this.

In essence the only thing we are changing is our consideration of different deltas in space-time. As we zoom out and out in our space-time delta. We have to change our language of how we actually talk about things as we zoom into larger and larger soace-time deltas. We cannot explain a human brain using the language of the Standard Modela and Feynman diagrams/integrals. We need new language which absracts out the lower levels. Whether this abstraction is an "emergent" property or not, is not up to me to decide. I am not interested in that. We also note that a simple change in delta of space-time does not imply we reached a more complex system. For instance, we can look at the space scale of a human brain and the space scale of a big big million old rock. We can increased in our delta of space as the rock is much bigger, and also time as we consider much more time when talking about the rock, instead of having to consider time on the oerde of seconds when lookin at brains systems. Yet a brain is more complex than the million year old big big rock. This is somthing to keep in mind when you are trying to map the whole universe into a frame as simple as "space-time deltas + complexity".
